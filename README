Task:
- Need to write minls and minget so that I can get data out of the Minix filesystem whilst being outside of the 
  minix filesystem
- Minget: has to parse through all the inodes and directory entries to to list all files and directories
- Minls: has to follow zone pointers to find where the data block is and retreive that data

How to break it up conceptually:
- Printing File: handles all the output and formatting
    - will deal with printing different stuff for the flags (-v -p)
- Common Helper File: includes common parsing functions
    - parsing partition table
        - tells me where the filesystem starts on the disk image
        - need this to locate the superblock 
    - reading superblock
        - tells me the size of each block
        - how many blocks are in each zone
        - total i-nodes
        - total zones
        - zone number where the datazone starts
        - the type of file system (magic number)
    - locating inodes and zones
        - tells me the type of the file and its permissions
        - the size of the file
        - pointers to the data zones
        - INODES ARE NUMBERED STARTING 1 NOT 0 !!!
    - endianess 
        - macos M1 is big endian? and minix is little endian so need to make sure it works to parse through minix
    - traversing directory entries
        - directory etnries map filenames to i-nodes
        - use that to traverse through and find the next file 
        - or use that to find the i-node of the file to copy and then go to the zone with its data
- Minget
    - parse through all the valid command line arguments 
    - traverse the direcories and find the block
    - read the file
    - deal with holes and empty zones 
    - write to stdout
- Minls
    - parse all the valid command line arguments
    - traverse through directoreis 
    - know the type of the files and directories through i-node info
    - print out the formatted strings to stdout


Functions planning to write: 
- Printing:
    - print_partition_table
    - print_superblock
    - print_inode
    - print_directory_list
- Helpers:
    - read_partition_table
    - parse_command_line (use getopt)
    - read_superblock (copy all data of that into a struct)
- Minls:
    - main (argv, argc)
    - traverse_directory
    - list_directory
- Minget:
    - main (argv, argc)
    - copy_file
    - handle_sparse_zone
